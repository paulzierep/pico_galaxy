This wrapper is available from the Galaxy Tool Shed at:

Automated Installation
======================

This should be straightforward, Galaxy should automatically download and install
the Jar files for effectiveT3 v1.0.1 and its associated models (animal, plant and
standard).


Manual Installation
===================

You can change the path by setting the environment variable ``$EFFECTIVET3`` to the
relevant folder, but by default it expects the following files to be installed
at these locations::

    /opt/EffectiveT3/TTSS_GUI-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_ANIMAL-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_PLANT-1.0.1.jar
    /opt/EffectiveT3/module/TTSS_STD-1.0.1.jar

To install the wrapper copy or move the following files under the Galaxy tools
folder, e.g. in a tools/effectiveT3 folder:

* ``effectiveT3.xml`` (the Galaxy tool definition)
* ``effectiveT3.py`` (the Python wrapper script)
* ``README.rst`` (this file)

Also copy ``effectiveT3.loc.sample`` to ``effectiveT3.loc`` in the ``tool-data``
folder (and edit if appropriate, e.g. to add or remove a model).

You will also need to modify the ``tools_conf.xml`` file to tell Galaxy to offer the
tool. If you are using other protein analysis tools like TMHMM or SignalP, put
it next to them. Just add the line::

  <tool file="effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml" />

If you wish to run the unit tests, also move/copy the ``test-data/`` files
under Galaxy's ``test-data/`` folder. Then::

    $ ./run_tests.sh -id effectiveT3

That's it.

Developers
==========

This script and related tools were initially developed on the following hg branch:
http://bitbucket.org/peterjc/galaxy-central/src/tools

Development has now moved to a dedicated GitHub repository:
https://github.com/peterjc/pico_galaxy/tree/master/tools/effectiveT3

For pushing a release to the test or main "Galaxy Tool Shed", use the following
Planemo commands (which requires you have set your Tool Shed access details in
``~/.planemo.yml`` and that you have access rights on the Tool Shed)::

    $ planemo shed_update -t testtoolshed --check_diff tools/effectiveT3/
    ...

or::

    $ planemo shed_update -t toolshed --check_diff tools/effectiveT3/
    ...

To just build and check the tar ball, use::

    $ planemo shed_upload --tar_only tools/effectiveT3/
    ...
    $ tar -tzf shed_upload.tar.gz
    tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample
    test-data/empty.fasta
    test-data/empty_effectiveT3.tabular
    test-data/four_human_proteins.fasta
    test-data/four_human_proteins.effectiveT3.tabular
    tool-data/effectiveT3.loc.sample
    tools/effectiveT3/README.rst
    tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.py
    tools/effectiveT3/effectiveT3.xml
    tools/effectiveT3/tool_dependencies.xml
